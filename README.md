Cafe:
This file contains a real-life simulate inventory and pricing management for a cafe.
A list called 'menu' containing items available in the cafe is created.
Then, two dictionaries: stock, which holds the stock quantity for each menu item, and price, which contains the price for each menu item are created.
The script then calculates the total stock worth of the cafe.
This is done by by looping through the menu list and using the corresponding values from the stock and price dictionaries.

Minesweeper:
This game possesses 2D list of a minesweeper grid with "#" representing mines and "-" representing empty cells.
Utilises predefined functions to calculate the number of adjacent mines for a given cell using directional offsets, 
and generate a new grid where each empty cell is replaced by the adjacent mine count.
Employs nested loops for grid traversal and boundary checking to prevent index out-of-bounds errors.
